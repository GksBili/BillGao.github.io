    This website is built to demonstrate the requirements for IAT355 Assignment 2.  
    It follows a modular structure consisting of the following files:
    
    1. index.html  
       - Contains background information such as skills, education, and projects.  
       - Uses the <nav> element to allow users to navigate to different sections of the page 
         by clicking on the corresponding title.

    2. style.css  
       - Defines all styles including colors, fonts, positioning, and margins.  
       - Includes interactive hover effects: when the user hovers over navigation titles 
         (e.g., "About Me," "Visualization," "Contact," or "Projects"), the background 
         and text color change for a better user experience.

    3. visualizations.html  
       - Displays all SVG-based drawings and visual elements.  
       - Follows the same standard website structure as index.html for consistency.

    4. vis.js  
       - Handles SVG interactions such as color and text changes.  
       - Provides logic for interactive elements, allowing users to dynamically 
         influence the visuals.

    5. main.js  
       - Supports additional site-wide interactivity and navigation logic.
